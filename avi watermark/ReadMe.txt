Section 1-Intro
---------------
	You've probably seen a AVI movie on your computer before where they have the advertisement or whatever on the buttom of the AVI, right? I'll bet you'd like to be able to do that with one of your own movies, huh? Well with AVI Watermark, you can! AVI Watermark can quickly add a watermark to any of your AVI files while keeping the quality and framerate the same. You can even choose the transparency of the watermark and its placement! You can choose to use the default watermark or select your own image. AVI Watermark is the first of its kind to appear on Planet Source Code. That means it's completely original. Please have fun and use your immagination ;)




Section 2-Selecting the AVI and Watermark File
----------------------------------------------
	The first step in making your AVI file is choosing the AVI movie file and the Watermark image. To select the movie file click the "Load AVI File" button. A file dialog will appear asking you the location of the AVI file. Select the file and a dialog with information about the AVI will appear. Press OK. If you want you can choose to load your own Watermark. Otherwise the default watermark will be used (it is the image in the Sample Movie window that says "Watermark"). Click the "Load Watermark" button and select your image.
	You may also customize the transparency and allignment options. To select the transparency, move the slider to the right of the Sample Movie window. As you move it, the watermark in the Sample Movie window will change. This is a preview of what the transparency will look like on the finished AVI. You can change the allignment by clicking the box under the Sample Movie window. You can choose either Center, Right Justify, or Left Justify. The Sample Movie window shows what the allignment will look like in the finished movie.
	Now you're ready to append the Watermark to the AVI...




Section 3-Appending
-------------------
	Now you're ready to append the watermark to the AVI file. After you have loaded the AVI file and the watermark file, and you have set the transparency and alignment, press the "Appenbd Watermark" button to begin Appending. If you have the preview option checked, you will be asked to continue appending. Appending may take a while and a considerable amount of space on your hard drive.
	Now you're ready to save the AVI movie...




Section 4-Save/Render the AVI file
----------------------------------
	Now for the last step: the actual rendering of the AVI. Click on the "Save AVI File" button and select the location in the file dialog box. You will be asked to decide what compression method you'de like to use. After you press OK the rendering will begin. If you have the Preview option checked, you'll see the video being made in the Preview window.
	After the rendering is complete, you now have a complete video with a custom watermark!




Section 5-Bugs
--------------
	There is only one bug that I know of: SOUND! AVI Watermark works by extracting Bitmap images from the AVI movie and saving them to your harddrive. Then it puts them into an AVI movie.  I know it's possible to extract the audio from the AVI movie and then puts it back into the finished one, but I don't know how that's accomplished. If anyone can tell me how to do that, I'd be very grateful. Thanks!




Section 6-Credit
----------------
	There is one person I really need to thank: Ray Mercer. His site: http://www.shrinkwrapvb.com/ has taught me all I know about AVI API in visual basic.
Thanks Ray!
