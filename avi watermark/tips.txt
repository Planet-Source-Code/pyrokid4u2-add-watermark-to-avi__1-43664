The Sample Movie window will show you (to proportion) what the saved AVI will look like. It shows the transparency, the watermark image, and the allignment.
Pressing the Load Watermark button allows you to choose your own watermark.
Choosing the allignment below the preview window will decide where the watermark is placed. If unchanged the allignment will be center.
You can change the transparency of the watermark by moving the slider to the right of the Sample Movie window.
Checking the preview option allows you to see a preview during the appending and rendering process.
If the preview option is selected, you will be shown a full preview (before the appending process) of the first frame of the AVI with the watermark. Then you will be asked if you want to continue.
When you press the save button and type in a filename, a dialog will appear. You can use this to select different encoding options.
AVI Watermark uses VB and API, yet no MCI API is used.
You can borrow code from my program, but if you do so, please give me credit.
